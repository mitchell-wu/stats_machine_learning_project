<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction
This project explores machine learning techniques to predict flight prices between Beijing and Shanghai, focusing on various influencing factors such as departure time, and carrier.

<a name="motivation"></a>
## Motivation
Triggered by personal travel experiences and sudden price changes in flight bookings, this project aims to demystify flight pricing dynamics and offer actionable insights for travelers.

<a name="programming-language"></a>
## Programming Language

The core programming language used in this project is **R**, renowned for its powerful capabilities in statistical analysis and data visualization. R offers a flexible environment for data manipulation, making it a top choice for machine learning projects, especially those involving complex data sets.

<a name="major-packages"></a>
## Major Packages:
- **tidyverse**: This is a collection of R packages designed for data science. It simplifies many common data operations, including data import, tidying, transformation, and visualization. 

- **tidymodels**: This package framework is crucial for modeling and statistical analysis in R. It provides a coherent and modern approach to building machine learning models. 

<a name="dataset-overview"></a>
## Dataset Overview
The dataset spans from January 4, 2019, to August 22, 2019, chosen to avoid the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation sector. It focuses exclusively on flights between Beijing and Shanghai.

<a name="project-methodology"></a>
## Project Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
- Data Cleaning and Variable Selection
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- K-fold Cross Validation
- Training Data with Multiple Models
- Parameters Tuning
- Model Evaluation and Testing

<a name="key-findings"></a>
## Key Findings
The Random Forest model emerged as the most effective, and the important map highlighting the significance of the different variables on flight prices.

<a name="future-work"></a>
## Future Work
Future enhancements include adding more variables like ticket policies(e.g. refunfable/non-refundable) and exploring models that can input takeoff and landing locations to expand the predictable range.

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction
This project explores machine learning techniques to predict flight prices between Beijing and Shanghai, focusing on various influencing factors such as departure time, carrier, and booking lead time.

<a name="motivation"></a>
## Motivation
Triggered by personal travel experiences and sudden price changes in flight bookings, this project aims to demystify flight pricing dynamics and offer actionable insights for travelers.

<a name="dataset-overview"></a>
## Dataset Overview
The dataset spans from January 4, 2019, to August 22, 2019, chosen to avoid the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation sector. It focuses exclusively on flights between Beijing and Shanghai.

<a name="project-methodology"></a>
## Project Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
- Data Cleaning and Variable Selection
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Development using Random Forest
- K-fold Cross Validation
- Model Evaluation and Testing

<a name="key-findings"></a>
## Key Findings
The Random Forest model emerged as the most effective, highlighting the significance of cabin class and carrier on flight prices.

<a name="future-work"></a>
## Future Work
Future enhancements include adding more variables like ticket policies and exploring models for other routes.
